## Dark Enlightenment Scroll | Poetic-Critical Text Generator
**Powered by GPT-4 and designed in p5.js**  
*Concept, programming, and sound design by Marlon Barrios Solano*

Dark Enlightenment Scroll is a generative poetic-critical text installation that uses GPT-4 to create manifesto-like texts exploring the intersection of technology, ideology, and power. This unique project leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model, integrated into a creative p5.js environment to produce a continuous scrolling text experience. The generated texts draw on cybernetics, post-democracy philosophies, surveillance capitalism, and techno-poetics, creating an unsettling critique of contemporary digital power structures. The app is fully responsive and designed for installation environments.

### âœ¨ Recent Updates

## Duet in Latent Space

Latent space refers to a conceptual and mathematical space generated by algorithms, particularly those used in machine learning and generative models. This space is characterized by the high-dimensional representation of data where similar data points are mapped closely together, and dissimilar points are further apart. In essence, latent spaces serve as the underlying structure that models use to understand and generate new data instances based on learned patterns, without being explicitly programmed with specific rules for every possible outcome.

The intention to perform actions in latent space, especially with a model, is to perform within an unknown probability space, utilizing the generative capabilities of the model to create art or perform in real-time. This process involves interacting with the model in a way that it generates outputs based on the vast, unseen dimensions of the data it has learned from, yet doing so in a manner that is unpredictable and unique to each performance. The performer, by manipulating inputs (prompts) or guiding the model's generative process, improvises with these outputs, creating an interplay between the expected and the unexpected, the known and the unknown. This act of performing in real-time within latent space becomes a dance (or a drawing) within a probability space.

# OpenAI + P5.js template by SpatialPixel

This is just a simple template to incorporate OpenAI's Node.js SDK into a P5.js sketch.

## Requirements

This template requires a recent version of Node.js, recommended version 16 or later.

Clone the repository with git...

    git clone https://github.com/spatialpixel/openai-p5js-template.git

...or [download the code from the repository](https://github.com/spatialpixel/openai-p5js-template) as a zip file.

Then install the libraries:

    cd openai-p5js-template
    npm install

## Start the dev environment

This template uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a local development server. Start it with the following:

    npm run dev

By default, this starts a local server at http://localhost:5173/. Just copy/paste this URL into
a browser window to view the app. This will automatically update when you save changes to your code (that is,
no manual refresh required!).

## OpenAI API Key

Remember to provide your OpenAI API key into `sketch.js`. Note that this is configured
for local development only, and this code should not be used on a production server.
